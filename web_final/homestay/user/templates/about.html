        community homestays in Nepal. We connect travelers with Communities across Nepal, providing <br>
        a unique opportunity to stay with Nepali families and immerse in real Nepali life. At the same time, <br>
        local communities get the opportunity to share their culture and landscapes with the world while gaining <br>
        access to a sustainable source of income through tourism. The authentic experiences we offer travelers are <br>
        created with the goal of having a positive impact on Nepali communities, women and families, as well as on the
        <br> travelers themselves.
